Welcome to Whisperwood Sanitorium…
</em>
												<br>
												<br>
										Kenzie has lived in Whisperwood since she was a child. She’d fallen into a
										strange but happy routine that included her best friend and boyfriend, but when
										he’s fired for inappropriate conduct, Kenzie begins to spiral. Her fixation on
										the newest resident becomes a welcome distraction but as Halloween approaches,
										she starts to wonder where Crane’s delusions end and a strange reality begins.
												<br>
												<br>
												<em>
…where the petting zoo gets a little insane.
</em>
												<br>
												<br>
										Crane has always avoided the living at all costs, his job in the morgue only
										helping his desires. When he runs into a mysterious stranger at a bar one night,
										his life takes a sudden turn into hell. Now, he’s hearing a mysterious voice and
										the proper jerk has a fascination with heads. Willingly checking himself into
										Whisperwood should have been the answer to his problems. Instead, the feisty
										blonde with a taste for trouble only seems to make his own yearning for blood
										stronger.
												<br>
												<br>
										When All Hallows Eve crashes down upon Kenzie and Crane, will they be strong
										enough to survive the massacre, or will they remain locked within the
										suffocating walls of Whisperwood Sanitorium?
												<br>
												<br>
										**Head Case contains depictions of gore, blood, and a sexy Horseman. Don't
										forget to mind your head...**

The next matriarch has been chosen. . .

</em>
													<br>
													<br>
											Sage has never wanted anything other than the freedom to live her own life,
											but when she is chosen as the next Matriarch of her people, everything
											changes. Sent on a journey to pass the tests of her ancestors, Sage must
											find her place in this world even though she doesn't know if she believes in
											the very spirits who chose her for the position.
													<br>
													<br>

											As if her life isn't complicated enough, she finds herself on the run with a
											pack of raptor shifters. Sage's newfound allies are dangerous predators but
											the attraction she feels to them is undeniable.
													<br>
													<br>

											With a new threat to the peninsula, Sage has her work cut out for her. No
											one said being the Matriarch would be easy.
													<br>
													<br>

											Can she make it back to her people with her body--and her heart--intact? Can
											she stop the traders who threaten her very way of life?
													<br>
													<br>

											With Kishil, Talon, and Elu at her side, maybe she can . . .

											*This is a reverse harem #whychoose romance set in the dinoverse. Due to
											steamy dinoshifters this story is not suitable for anyone under 18.

											*M/M content
													<br>
											*The heroine has multiple love interests and does not have to choose.

Rowena Wickham only wanted one thing: freedom.

													<br>
													<br>
											But the Wild West is a brutal place filled with dinosaurs and outlaws. With
											no other option, Rowena became one of the very outlaws the West is ran by,
											and she made her own mark in the world.
													<br>
													<br>
											With too many mouths to feed in her crew, the Free Outlaws, Rowena has no
											choice but to hit something big, the place that was rumored to be equal
											between dinosaurs and humans alike, Embertown. She never expected the bank
											owner to be a tyrannosaurus rex. She certainly never expected the same of
											the Sheriff.
													<br>
													<br>
											But Rowena has a bigger problem. Not only is she dangerously attracted to
											the men she plans to rob, but Les ‘The Croc’ Chambers is headed towards
											Embertown, and Ro will do anything to escape his claws.
													<br>
													<br>

											Rowena just has to rob the bank under the clever noses of Sheriff Bennett
											and Virgil King, and skip town before they notice.

**Rexes & Robbers is a ménage book within the Dinoverse and includes a tough outlaw and some sexy tyrannosaurus rex shifters. If bank robbery isn’t your thing, don’t worry, Ro has you covered. **

A deadly disease has spread through the Blooming Courts of Tuatha.
</em>
													<br>
													<br>
The louloudi are meant to flourish for a thousand years before they return to the Earth. Death has been a distant foe for so long, no one spares it any thought. Until now. As sickness sweeps through the kingdom, with the cure always just out of reach, the courts have never been filled with so many blossoms. Even in death, they breathe life.
													<br>
													<br>
Ila Slystina has been raised in the confines of the Orchidasi Kingdom, wanting for nothing, hidden away like some sparkling treasure, but she dreams of so much more. When she’s caught returning from a forbidden trip, her mother, the Queen, punishes her the only way she sees fit.
													<br>
													<br>
Ila is sent on her season far earlier than she should be. Now, she’s being paraded through the twelve courts like a prized cow and she wants nothing more than to escape. But along the way, she just might get more than what she bargained for.
													<br>
													<br>
After all, the courts aren’t the only things that must bloom . . .
