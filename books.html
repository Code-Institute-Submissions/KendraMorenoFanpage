							Book 1)</h6>
						<div>
							Victoria Greene would rather spend her time with machines than the high society she comes
							into contact with in London. She's happy with her gears and cogs, even if that means she
							will end up a spinster.
							<br>
							<br>
When her father gets the funding for a trip to the Amazon to search for a mythical jewel, she jumps on the chance to come aboard as the Master Tinker. She expected to work on the massive boilers for the airship and to tinker with her mechanical creatures. She never expected the men suddenly thrown into her life making it even more interesting. The inventor, the cowboy, the scholar, and the dreamer are all intrigued by the woman who comes with grease on her face.
							<br>
							<br>
But something sinister is amiss aboard the airship and she's determined to get to the bottom of it. Victoria's suspicion rises the closer they get to Brazil and she must figure out the nefarious plans before it's too late.
							<br>
							<br>
Can Victoria protect them all against the dangers, from onboard and the rainforest alike? Can such an eclectic team work together and find the Temple of the Rising Sun?
							<br>
							<br>
Let the adventure begin...
							<br>
							<br>
**This is a Reverse Harem, which means there are mulitple love interests and the Leading Lady doesn't have to choose. It contains mature content, lots of adventure, and some well dressed men.**

								Book 2)</h6>
							<div>
								Victoria Greene always thought that returning to London would put her life back in some
								sort of order. The adventure was over, the mission completed, and she assumed she could
								continue her work with machines in peace, but Vic should have known that such a thing
								was not possible. Instead, she suddenly finds herself dealing with judgmental Elite, the
								corrupt High Council, and the certainty that London has deeper secrets than she ever
								knew. When the Queen of England sends Vic and her men on yet another task of the highest
								importance, Vic is relieved, if only to escape the city that feels less like home than
								an airship.
								<br>
								<br>
But Vic is not the only one racing around the world. The High Council is on their tail, and they have no qualms about doing anything it takes to win.
								<br>
								<br>
Now, the Lost City of Kásskara beckons, and with Bram, Emory, Jules, and Jed by her side, Vic must find the sunken world fast. There are too many perplexities surrounding the disappearance of Kásskara and no one wants to speak its name.
								<br>
								<br>
Some cities should never be discovered. Some machines should never be created. Some secrets were meant to die in the past.

Descend into Madness…

								<br>
								<br>
Clara spent her whole life fighting in courtrooms for the downtrodden, the strange ones, the abused. It’s only natural that when a man with rabbit ears on his head comes to see her, she doesn’t blink an eye…
								<br>
...until he opens a portal and drags her to Wonderland.
								<br>
								<br>
But this isn’t the world she’s read about at home. This world has been twisted, poisoned by none other than the Red Queen.
								<br>
								<br>
There’s a prophecy, the only chance Wonderland has of survival. Clara is foretold to defeat the Knave and claim the Hatter’s heart. But there’s a problem. The Hatter is insane and Wonderland is full of unspeakable horrors. Death waits behind every tree. If the Beezles don’t get you, the Bandersnatch will.
								<br>
								<br>
Can Clara embrace the madness and her destiny, or will the reign of the Red Queen continue?

									<i>Tock.</i>
									<br>
When that same white rabbit turns out to be the White Rabbit from the story books, she can’t contain her curiosity. She follows him down the rabbit hole and drops right into Wonderland. But this isn’t the Wonderland she hoped for. The world is filled with danger, horrifying creatures, and a prophecy that speaks of her role.
									<br>
									<i>Tick.</i>
									<br>
Jupiter never thought her adventure would include blood-thirty Bandersnatch, a Vengeful Red Queen, or a sexy White Rabbit. Nor did she ever think she was an important part of saving such nightmares, but a certain Rabbit drew her into this gruesome world, and she’s determined to stay by his side.
									<br>
									<i>Tock.</i>

Jupiter has to act quickly. The Red Queen is growing more desperate to stop the prophecy from coming true. Jupiter is only the second . . .

Welcome to Whisperwood Sanitorium…
</b>
													<br>
													<br>
Kenzie has lived in Whisperwood since she was a child. She’d fallen into a strange but happy routine that included her best friend and boyfriend, but when he’s fired for inappropriate conduct, Kenzie begins to spiral. Her fixation on the newest resident becomes a welcome distraction but as Halloween approaches, she starts to wonder where Crane’s delusions end and a strange reality begins.
													<br>
													<br>
													<i>
…where the petting zoo gets a little insane.
</i>
													<br>
													<br>
Crane has always avoided the living at all costs, his job in the morgue only helping his desires. When he runs into a mysterious stranger at a bar one night, his life takes a sudden turn into hell. Now, he’s hearing a mysterious voice and the proper jerk has a fascination with heads. Willingly checking himself into Whisperwood should have been the answer to his problems. Instead, the feisty blonde with a taste for trouble only seems to make his own yearning for blood stronger.
													<br>
													<br>
When All Hallows Eve crashes down upon Kenzie and Crane, will they be strong enough to survive the massacre, or will they remain locked within the suffocating walls of Whisperwood Sanitorium?

As if her life isn't complicated enough, she finds herself on the run with a pack of raptor shifters. Sage's newfound allies are dangerous predators but the attraction she feels to them is undeniable.

Rowena Wickham only wanted one thing: freedom.

But the Wild West is a brutal place filled with dinosaurs and outlaws. With no other option, Rowena became one of the very outlaws the West is ran by, and she made her own mark in the world.
															<br>
															<br>
With too many mouths to feed in her crew, the Free Outlaws, Rowena has no choice but to hit something big, the place that was rumored to be equal between dinosaurs and humans alike, Embertown. She never expected the bank owner to be a tyrannosaurus rex. She certainly never expected the same of the Sheriff.
															<br>

But Rowena has a bigger problem. Not only is she dangerously attracted to the men she plans to rob, but Les ‘The Croc’ Chambers is headed towards Embertown, and Ro will do anything to escape his claws.
															<br>

Rowena just has to rob the bank under the clever noses of Sheriff Bennett and Virgil King, and skip town before they notice.
