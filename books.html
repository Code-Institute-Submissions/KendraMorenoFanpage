										Victoria Greene would rather spend her time with machines than the high society
										she comes
										into contact with in London. She's happy with her gears and cogs, even if that
										means she
										will end up a spinster.
										<br>
										<br>
										When her father gets the funding for a trip to the Amazon to search for a
										mythical jewel, she jumps on the chance to come aboard as the Master Tinker. She
										expected to work on the massive boilers for the airship and to tinker with her
										mechanical creatures. She never expected the men suddenly thrown into her life
										making it even more interesting. The inventor, the cowboy, the scholar, and the
										dreamer are all intrigued by the woman who comes with grease on her face.
										<br>
										<br>
										But something sinister is amiss aboard the airship and she's determined to get
										to the bottom of it. Victoria's suspicion rises the closer they get to Brazil
										and she must figure out the nefarious plans before it's too late.
										<br>
										<br>
										Can Victoria protect them all against the dangers, from onboard and the
										rainforest alike? Can such an eclectic team work together and find the Temple of
										the Rising Sun?
										<br>
										<br>
										Let the adventure begin...
										<br>
										<br>
										**This is a Reverse Harem, which means there are mulitple love interests and the
										Leading Lady doesn't have to choose. It contains mature content, lots of
										adventure, and some well dressed men.**

											Victoria Greene always thought that returning to London would put her
											life
											back
											in some
											sort of order. The adventure was over, the mission completed, and she
											assumed
											she could
											continue her work with machines in peace, but Vic should have known that
											such a
											thing
											was not possible. Instead, she suddenly finds herself dealing with
											judgmental
											Elite, the
											corrupt High Council, and the certainty that London has deeper secrets
											than
											she
											ever
											knew. When the Queen of England sends Vic and her men on yet another
											task of
											the
											highest
											importance, Vic is relieved, if only to escape the city that feels less
											like
											home than
											an airship.
											<br>
											<br>
											But Vic is not the only one racing around the world. The High Council is on
											their tail, and they have no qualms about doing anything it takes to win.
											<br>
											<br>
											Now, the Lost City of Kásskara beckons, and with Bram, Emory, Jules, and Jed
											by her side, Vic must find the sunken world fast. There are too many
											perplexities surrounding the disappearance of Kásskara and no one wants to
											speak its name.
											<br>
											<br>
											Some cities should never be discovered. Some machines should never be
											created. Some secrets were meant to die in the past.

										Clara spent her whole life fighting in courtrooms for the downtrodden, the

										his head comes to see her, she doesn’t blink an eye…
										<br>
										...until he opens a portal and drags her to Wonderland.

										<br>
										But this isn’t the world she’s read about at home. This world has been twisted,

										There’s a prophecy, the only chance Wonderland has of survival. Clara is
