# Kendra Moreno Fanpage
___

This page was created for the first milestone project of Code Institute's User Centric Frontend Development module. Kendra Moreno is a fantasy romance writer who focuses primarily, but not solely, on darker fantasy romance and some reverse harem, also know as "why choose" romance. She often works with Poppy Woods and K.A. Knight. This site lists the books Kendra has written, including summaries where to purchase them. Also listed are her where you can find information directly from Kendra, including upcoming books, giveaways, promotions and even where she looks for people for her advanced reader copy team.

## UX
___

 This page is aimed at potential readers who may be interested in the different genres Kendra specialises in, or finding out more about where to find information about Kendra and her books. To make it easier to find their way to more information about Kendra and how to find her I included a side panel on every page with her professional social media presence, including her own website, Facebook, Facebook group, Twitter, Goodreads, Amazon UK, and Amazon US pages. These are also linked in the footer.

## Features
___

### Existing Features


-The "Home" or cover page

-The "About" page which includes a short summary of Kendra

-The "Solo Books" which includes summaries and purchase links, of Kendra's solo works

-The "Collaborations" which includes summaries and purchase links, of works Kendra as collaborated on

Both the Solo Books and the Collaborations pages have a menu at the top with clickable links to each summary as well as a link at the bottom of each summary to return to the top. 

 Each page is divided into:
..*
*The header
*Left side panel
*Main section 
*Footer

 The header, footer and left-side panel remain consistent through all four pages. This allows for easy navigation to each of the other pages and access to the authors own pages and book sales at any time. 

### Features Left to Implement

Adding the covers to the book summaries with collapsible using either Bootstrap "collapse", or "read more" using JQuery. The images would be linked to Amazon to encourage the reader to purchase the book. It should increase interest and keep the page clean.

Creating pages for other members of the authors usual writing group. Poppy Woods and K.A. Knight and linking them to this page. This would allow users to discover all 3 authors more easily and increase interest in all 3.

Continued improvement, and streamlining, of current code as well as updating with new skills, techniques and technologies as applicable

## Acknowledgements
___

When discussing what projects would be appropriate, one of the suggestions my program mentor, Rhey Ann Magcalas, made was for bands, authors, or similar that I enjoy. I am an advanced copy reader for Kendra Moreno and I couldn't enjoy it more. I tried to base the colouring, font style and general make up of the page on Kendra's own aesthetic based on what I've seen of her own posts and pages in the past.
